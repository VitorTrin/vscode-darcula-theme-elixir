# README

A fork of the [Darcula theme for Elixir](https://github.com/arsssen/vscode-darcula-theme-elixir) edited for less contrast. The original was very good (and your only real option for vscode elixir syntax highlights), but ugh! My eyes!

A theme extension for Visual Studio Code based on Darcula theme from Jetbrains IDEs.
Mainly focused on elixir language.
